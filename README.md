# SF Movie Map

-The SF Movie Map creates a way to visualize where moveies were filmed in San Francisco and the Bay Area, and details on those movies.

-Focused on full stack

-Chose to utilize the MEAN Stack because of my familiarity with javascript web development. Used the [Angular Fullstack Generator](https://github.com/angular-fullstack/generator-angular-fullstack) for this app and most of my code is in the app/main and server/api/film directories. I spent a lot of time working on programmatically figuring out how to geolocate the location strings in the datasource, and I would like to refactor that to more efficently do that, and have all of that logic on the server side. As for the front end I had some issues with making the marker info box being dynamic, and implementing the search field functionality. If I have more time I would like to try another map directive out and clean up the controller. I have not used ES6/Babel before so I know there is a lot more efficent ways to improve that.
